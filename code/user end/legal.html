		<h3 class="contentText">This project is part of the <a href="https://shepai.github.io">SHEP</a> project, an
		on going AI prject started in 2015. This chatbot removes the self-learning aspects in order to get accurate responses
		entered by the university staff.
		<br><br>
		A problem for students is having too much information and recourses thrown at them, and not knowing who to turn to for information. This results in university staff having to check their emails all the time and answer questions over and over again. Then the same events happen with the next year group. This also means students need to wait for a response. Would it not be better if these questions and answers were written in a database and kept updated by university staff? This would allow students to get instant responses, and keep university staff emails free for questions which can’t be answered.
